# TriviaGame

### The hard mode version of TriviaGame. 

### This is the play rule:

* Hit the start button to start the game.
* You should answer it within 5s. (I know, it is challenging, but just push yourself, does this sound familier?)
* Each question has only one correct answer.
* If you didn't choose an answer, the result for this question will be marked as wrong. And the correct answer will be shown on the screen.
* No matter the answer is correct or not, the correct answer will be shown after each question page and stay for 3 seconds.
* You will see your result at the end of the game. And start over the game by click the startover button.
