# TriviaGame

### This game probobly the most challenging one to me so far. I choosed the hard mode version of TriviaGame. 

### This is the play rule:

* Hit the start button to start the game.
* You should answer it within 5s. (I know, it is challenging, but just push yourself, is this sounds familier?)
* Each question has only one correct answer.
* If you didn't choose an answer, the result for this question will be marked as wrong. And the correct answer will be shown on the screen.
* No matter the answer is correct or not, the correct answer will be shown after each question page and stay for 3 seconds.
* You will see your result at the end of the game. And start over the game by click the startover button.

Specially thanks for my husband, who helps me to debug on time control function and move-onto-next-page function! Without him, this project could be harder to me.
